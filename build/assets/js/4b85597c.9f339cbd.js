It is highly recommended to use a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) for the best experience with ROS 2 and Gazebo.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"robot-simulation-basics/lesson2":{"id":"robot-simulation-basics/lesson2","title":"Lesson 2: Anatomy of a Robot - Links and Joints","description":"Ever wondered how a robot moves? It all boils down to its fundamental building blocks: links and joints. Think of links as the robot\'s \\"bones\\" and joints as its \\"articulations\\" or \\"pivot points.\\" Together, they create the complex movements we see in everything from industrial arms to humanoid robots.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"robot-simulation-basics/lesson3":{"id":"robot-simulation-basics/lesson3","title":"Lesson 3: Giving Your Robot a Body: Visuals, Collisions, and Physics!","description":"Welcome back, future robot builders! In our last lesson, we learned about the bones (links) and joints that make up your robot\'s skeleton. Pretty cool, right? But a skeleton needs a body to interact with the world! \ud83c\udf0e","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"robot-simulation-basics/lesson4":{"id":"robot-simulation-basics/lesson4","title":"Lesson 4: Diving into Gazebo","description":"Welcome to Gazebo, where your robots come to life in a virtual playground!
