## Prompt

Write lesson 7 for the current chapter based on tasks T031, T032, T033, and T034 from `tasks.md`. The lesson should write an introduction to Unity as a high-fidelity simulator, explain its key advantages (photorealism, advanced rendering), detail specific use cases for Unity in robotics (e.g., vision AI training, realistic scene generation), and compare and contrast Gazebo and Unity's strengths and weaknesses conceptually. Save the lesson to `D:\physical-ai\docs\02-robot-simulation-basics\lesson7.md`

## Response snapshot

The lesson content for "Lesson 7: Unveiling Unity - High-Fidelity Robotics Simulation" was generated and saved to `D:\physical-ai\docs\02-robot-simulation-basics\lesson7.md`. This lesson introduces Unity as a high-fidelity simulator, details its advantages and use cases in robotics, and conceptually compares it with Gazebo.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Lesson 7 on Unity as a high-fidelity robotics simulator was created, covering its advantages, use cases, and a comparison with Gazebo.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: `D:\physical-ai\docs\02-robot-simulation-basics\lesson7.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring a fallback to agent-native PHR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script failed to execute.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate the path to `create-phr.sh` or ensure it's available in the agent's environment.
