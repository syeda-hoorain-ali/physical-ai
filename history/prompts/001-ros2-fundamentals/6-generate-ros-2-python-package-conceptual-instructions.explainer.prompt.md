COMMAND: Generate step-by-step conceptual instructions in markdown format for creating a Python ROS 2 package. Focus on explaining the purpose of each step (e.g., what `ros2 pkg create` does, the structure of a Python package, `setup.py`, `package.xml`). Do not execute any commands. Include simple, illustrative bash command examples and their conceptual output. Append this content to `docs/01-ros2-fundamentals/lesson3.md`.

RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  I have successfully appended the conceptual instructions for creating a Python ROS 2 package to `C:\Users\dell\Desktop\physical-ai\worktrees\chapter1\docs\01-ros2-fundamentals\lesson3.md`.

  Please confirm if the content meets your expectations. Once confirmed, I can proceed with generating images for any placeholders in that lesson using the `image-generator` skill, if any are present or you'd like to add them.

  Follow-up:
  *   Confirm the content.
  *   Let me know if you would like to add any image placeholders or generate images for existing ones.

  Files modified:
  - `C:\Users\dell\Desktop\physical-ai\worktrees\chapter1\docs\01-ros2-fundamentals\lesson3.md`
OUTCOME: Appended conceptual instructions to an existing documentation file.
EVALUATION: The task was completed successfully by reading the existing file, appending the new content, and writing it back.
