PROMPT_TEXT: |
  Continue developing the content for the "ROS 2 Fundamentals: Building the Robotic Nervous System" chapter. Specifically, focus on User Story 2, tasks T017 and T018: write example code for a simple `rclpy` publisher node in `docs/01-ros2-fundamentals/lesson3_code/publisher.py` and a simple `rclpy` subscriber node in `docs/01-ros2-fundamentals/lesson3_code/subscriber.py`. Ensure the code is clear, concise, and illustrative for a textbook context. After completing these tasks, **you must update the `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/tasks.md` file to mark them as completed**. Also, ensure all other content adheres to the project's constitution and style guidelines. I will confirm the content and generate images for any placeholders after all content generation is complete.
RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  I have successfully created the `publisher.py` and `subscriber.py` files and updated the `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/tasks.md` to mark tasks T017 and T018 as complete.
OUTCOME: Success
EVALUATION: The task of creating publisher and subscriber nodes and updating the task list was completed as requested.
