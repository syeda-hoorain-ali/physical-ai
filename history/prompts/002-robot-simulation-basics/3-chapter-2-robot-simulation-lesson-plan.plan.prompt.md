## Prompt

Break down the provided chapter specifications into a detailed lesson-by-lesson implementation plan, including skill mapping, cognitive load validation, and actionable task checklists for each lesson. The specs are to be found in the `specs/002-robot-simulation-basics/` directory.

## Response snapshot

Generated a comprehensive, structured lesson-by-lesson implementation plan for Chapter 2: "The Digital Twin: Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity." The plan includes:

- Seven distinct lessons covering introduction to digital twins, URDF modeling (Part 1 & 2), Gazebo world building, ROS 2 integration with Gazebo, simulating sensors, and an introduction to high-fidelity simulation with Unity.
- Clear, measurable learning objectives for each lesson.
- Skill mapping for each objective using Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised).
- Cognitive load assessment for each lesson with mitigation strategies where necessary.
- Detailed, actionable task checklists for content creators.
- A "Follow-ups and Risks" section for potential issues and clarifications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed lesson plan generated
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this planning task.
- 📁 Files: Created one PHR file at C:\Users\dell\Desktop\physical-ai\worktrees\chapter2\history\prompts\002-robot-simulation-basics\3-chapter-2-robot-simulation-lesson-plan.plan.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User confirmation of the lesson plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated a comprehensive lesson plan adhering to all specified requirements.
