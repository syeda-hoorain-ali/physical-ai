## Prompt

Create educational content for Lesson 5: Nav2 Navigation for Humanoid Robots. This lesson should enable students to configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement planning with stability considerations. The content should include:

1. Learning objectives aligned with CEFR/Bloom's taxonomy
2. Prerequisites from previous lessons
3. Detailed explanation of Nav2 framework and humanoid-specific constraints
4. Step-by-step Nav2 installation and configuration guide
5. Bipedal constraint integration tutorial
6. Navigation testing scenarios
7. Stability-aware path planning exercises
8. Navigation evaluation framework
9. Troubleshooting guide for navigation issues
10. Hands-on activities and exercises
11. Assessment criteria
12. Connection to the overall chapter goals
13. Placeholders for images, infographics, and diagrams

The content should be structured as a Docusaurus markdown file with appropriate headings and formatting. Make sure to include image placeholders as ![alt text](./images/image-name.png "title").

## Response snapshot

I have created comprehensive educational content for Lesson 5: Nav2 Navigation for Humanoid Robots. The content includes:

1. Learning objectives aligned with CEFR/Bloom's taxonomy
2. Prerequisites section from previous lessons
3. Detailed explanation of Nav2 framework with humanoid constraints
4. Step-by-step Nav2 installation and configuration guide
5. Bipedal constraint integration tutorial with code examples
6. Navigation testing scenarios
7. Stability-aware path planning exercises with Python code
8. Navigation evaluation framework with performance metrics
9. Troubleshooting guide for navigation issues
10. Hands-on activities and exercises
11. Assessment criteria
12. Connection to overall chapter goals
13. Image placeholders throughout the content

The content has been structured as a Docusaurus markdown file and saved to docs/lessons/lesson-5-nav2-navigation-humanoid-robots.md. The lesson covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementation aspects of Nav2 navigation for humanoid robots, with special emphasis on stability considerations for bipedal movement.
