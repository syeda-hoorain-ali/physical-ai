# Prompt History Record: Isaac Sim Photorealistic Simulation Fundamentals Lesson

## Original Prompt
Create educational content for Lesson 2: Isaac Sim Photorealistic Simulation Fundamentals. This lesson should enable students to create photorealistic simulation environments for humanoid robots with realistic physics and lighting. The content should include:

1. Learning objectives aligned with CEFR/Bloom's taxonomy
2. Prerequisites from previous lessons
3. Detailed explanation of Isaac Sim architecture and capabilities
4. Step-by-step instructions for creating photorealistic environments
5. Physics configuration exercises
6. Synthetic data generation workflow
7. Environment interaction scenarios
8. Assessment rubric for environment quality
9. Documentation template for simulation environments
10. Hands-on activities and exercises
11. Assessment criteria
12. Connection to the overall chapter goals
13. Placeholders for images, infographics, and diagrams

The content should be structured as a Docusaurus markdown file with appropriate headings and formatting. Make sure to include image placeholders as ![alt text](./images/image-name.png "title").

## Response
[Response content would be the full lesson content created above]

## Outcome
Successfully created comprehensive educational content for Lesson 2: Isaac Sim Photorealistic Simulation Fundamentals, including all 13 required elements with proper Docusaurus formatting, hands-on activities, and assessment criteria.
