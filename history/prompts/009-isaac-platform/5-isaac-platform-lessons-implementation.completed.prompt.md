## Prompt

sp.implement

## Response snapshot

I have successfully completed the implementation of the Isaac Platform educational content. All 7 lessons have been created with comprehensive content and properly integrated image placeholders:

### Lessons Created:
1. Lesson 1: Isaac Platform Setup and Configuration
2. Lesson 2: Isaac Sim Photorealistic Simulation Fundamentals
3. Lesson 3: Isaac ROS Hardware-Accelerated Perception
4. Lesson 4: Visual SLAM (VSLAM) Implementation
5. Lesson 5: Nav2 Navigation for Humanoid Robots
6. Lesson 6: Isaac Platform Integration and Testing
7. Lesson 7: Deployment to Edge Computing Platforms

### Content Features:
- Learning objectives aligned with CEFR/Bloom's taxonomy
- Prerequisites clearly defined for each lesson
- Detailed step-by-step instructions with code examples and outputs
- Hands-on activities and exercises
- Troubleshooting guides
- Assessment criteria
- Connection to overall chapter goals

### Image Integration:
- Created 32 placeholder images in the static/img/chapter-03 directory
- Integrated images throughout lessons where pedagogically appropriate
- Used proper Docusaurus markdown formatting for image references
- Removed duplicate image placeholders at the end of lessons

### Directory Structure:
- Created proper directory structure: book-source/docs/03-the-ai-robot-brain-nvidia-isaac/
- Added _category_.json file for Docusaurus documentation navigation
- Organized images in static/img/chapter-03/ directory

All tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed successfully and marked as [X] in the task list. The implementation follows the educational standards for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics with appropriate content structure and formatting.

## Outcome

- ✅ All 7 lessons created with comprehensive educational content
- ✅ All 32 images properly created and integrated into lessons
- ✅ Directory structure properly organized
- ✅ Tasks file updated with all tasks marked as completed
- ✅ Content follows CEFR/Bloom's taxonomy alignment
- ✅ Lessons are pedagogically sound with hands-on activities and assessments
- ✅ Image placeholders properly integrated throughout content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Success rate: 100% of tasks completed successfully
- All lessons meet the educational objectives outlined in the specification
- Content maintains consistent structure and quality across all lessons
- Images are strategically placed to enhance learning outcomes
- All technical requirements from the specification have been fulfilled
