where you have write "D:\physical-ai\docs\02-robot-simulation-basics\two_link_robot.urdf" in lesson2, it's not good, as students don't have access to my pc, 
instead give them code and tell where to write it, use `title="path/to/filename.abc"` to define filename, also use context7 to get docusaurus docs


Tips:
- use <details> & <summary> code blocks to make collapsible section in markdown
- use comments with `highlight-next-line`, `highlight-start`  and `highlight-end` to select which line are highlighted 
- or you can use sytax like like "```jsx {1,4-6,11}" to highlight 1st, 4th to 6th and 11th line
- enable line numbring for code block by using `showLineNumbers` key within the language meta string
- can also give value like `showLineNumbers=3`
