# Implementation Tasks: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

**Feature Branch**: `001-intro-physical-ai` | **Date**: 2025-11-29 | **Spec**: [specs/001-intro-physical-ai/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Plan**: [specs/001-intro-physical-ai/plan.md](./plan.md)

## Summary
This document outlines the detailed implementation tasks for the "Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence" chapter, organized by lesson, to facilitate content creation.

## Dependencies
- User Story 1 (Understand Physical AI Concepts) is the foundational story for this chapter. All lessons within this chapter contribute to this story.

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create documentation environment (e.g., Docusaurus setup if not already done)
- [x] T002 Ensure necessary tools for content creation are accessible and configured

## Phase 2: Foundational

- [x] T003 Review Constitution principles for content alignment in docs/
- [x] T004 Review existing project structure and identify optimal location for new chapter content in docs/

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understand Physical AI Concepts (Priority: P1)

### Story Goal
Students will gain a foundational understanding of Physical AI, embodied intelligence, and the rationale behind the growing importance of humanoid robotics.

### Independent Test
Students can be tested on their comprehension of Physical AI definitions, the significance of humanoid robots, and the core concepts of embodied intelligence through quizzes or short answer questions based solely on this chapter's content.

### Implementation Tasks

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

- [x] T005 [US1] Write a concise historical overview of AI development, detailing 3-4 key limitations of digital-only AI with illustrative examples in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T006 [US1] Craft an introductory narrative explaining the motivation for AI moving into the physical world and define "Physical AI" at a high level in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T007 [US1] Write a section detailing the advantages of humanoid robots for human interaction and explain how humanoid form factors enable natural data collection in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T008 [US1] Develop a clear explanation of how humanoid robots represent a significant transition towards embodied intelligence, linking back to AI's evolution in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T009 [US1] Write an in-depth explanation of embodied intelligence, focusing on "comprehending physical laws," and provide 2-3 brief, illustrative examples in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T010 [US1] Outline the key challenges (e.g., real-time perception, dexterous manipulation, safe navigation) and opportunities of embodied AI in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T011 [US1] Briefly introduce ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac, highlighting their roles in robot development and simulation in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T012 [US1] Reiterate the capstone goal of designing humanoid robots for natural human interactions and connect the principles of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence to the course learning outcomes in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T013 [US1] Introduce all key terminology: "Physical AI," "Embodied Intelligence," "Humanoid Robotics," "Digital Twin," "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)," ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac in docs/01-introduction.md

## Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T021 [P] Ensure all terminology introduced in the chapter is clearly defined and consistently used throughout the course materials in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T022 [P] Verify that the tone and style remain engaging and inspiring while maintaining academic rigor across all lessons in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T023 [P] Review for clarity, grammar, spelling, and adherence to textbook style guide in docs/01-introduction.md
- [x] T024 [P] Integrate relevant ethical considerations into appropriate lessons in docs/01-introduction.md
