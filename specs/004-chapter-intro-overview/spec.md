# Feature Specification: Introduction/Overview for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Chapters

**Feature Branch**: `004-chapter-intro-overview`
**Created**: 2025-12-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "write specification for creating just introduction/overview for these chapters"

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Understand Course Structure (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to read a concise introduction and overview for each chapter so that I can understand the logical flow of the course and what I will learn in each section.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for students to gain a foundational understanding of the course roadmap, manage their expectations, and see the progression of topics. Without a clear overview, students might feel lost or struggle to connect concepts between chapters.

**Independent Test**: A student can read the introduction/overview and articulate the main topic and purpose of each chapter without prior knowledge of the course content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am a new student to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, **When** I read the introduction and chapter overviews, **Then** I can clearly identify the focus of each of the six chapters.
2.  **Given** I am a new student, **When** I read the chapter overviews, **Then** I can understand the progression of topics from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The introduction/overview MUST provide a high-level summary of the entire Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
-   **FR-002**: For each of the six chapters (Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence, ROS 2 Fundamentals, Robot Simulation with Gazebo & Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Platform, Humanoid Robot Development, Conversational Robotics), the overview MUST clearly state the chapter's main theme and key learning objectives.
-   **FR-003**: The overview for each chapter MUST highlight how it contributes to the overall goal of bridging digital AI with the physical world.
-   **FR-004**: The content MUST be written in a clear, engaging, and pedagogically sound manner suitable for beginners.

### Key Entities

(Not applicable as this feature involves informational content, not managing data entities.)

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 90% of new students (surveyed after reading the introduction/overview) report a clear understanding of the course structure and chapter topics.
-   **SC-002**: Students can correctly match each chapter title with its primary focus as described in the overview.
-   **SC-003**: The introduction/overview effectively motivates students by clearly articulating the "why" behind learning Physical AI, as measured by positive qualitative feedback.
